## Disney World Ride

### Web Scraper

This python script gets wait times of each park @ Disney World and stores them in a SQLite Database.
The web scraper is dynamic in nature which means it will basically be running a CRON job i.e. the scraper will get updated wait times of the rides based on a set interval of time.
