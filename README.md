## Disney World Ride

### Web Scraper

This Python script gets wait times of each ride @ each park of Disney World and stores them in a SQLite Database.
The web scraper is dynamic in nature which means it will basically be running a CRON job i.e. the scraper will get updated wait times of the rides based on a set interval of time. 

All of the files necessary for the script are in the repository. Feel free to get an idea on how dynamic web scraping works.
